## Note for future students
This is important to anyone who's interested in the game's development process in general - The compressed release files DO NOT CONTAIN everything that's used for development and a lot of it is ommitted. If you want to have a full look, always download the source of that specific release. Older releases that were not uploaded to github are in the Project Archive linked at the end of this Readme
## How to run (Latest Versions)
Open terminal from the game directory and type in the following:
```
./fpgrars-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe main.s
```
Or run the executable .bat file which does the above for you automatically

## How to run (Versions Prior to 1.1.0)
Open terminal from the game directory and type in the following:
```
./fpgrars-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc--unb.exe main.s
```
Or run the executable .bat file which does the above for you automatically

Make sure you have the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redist installed on your computer as FPGRARS depends on it<br>
