Notes for project judges

It should be noted that the game simply does not run in regular RARS as
1 - it's slow (words can't describe how slow it is)
2 - it doesn't like unaligned memory and we couldn't bother aligning everything
3 - it's buggy - some snippets of code simply don't run for absolutely no reason
