It turns out the game's implementation has been severely limited due to a bug in FPGRARS
To put it simply, FPGRARS apparently crashes if one makes too many system calls.

That bug is better described in the GitHub issue below, with some example code that triggers it

https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS/issues/45

The game is able to run for approximately 6 minutes before crashing - likely due to the intensive use of the
sleep [32] system call for tickrate control. This bug also made using the time system call for controlling the
tickrate impractical, as the game would crash near instantly.

TL;DR the game isn't crashing after 6 minutes because of a fault in the code, but because of a fault in the
simulator

It should also be noted that the game simply does not run in regular RARS as
1 - it's slow (words can't describe how slow it is)
2 - it doesn't like unaligned memory and we couldn't bother aligning everything
3 - it's buggy - some snippets of code simply don't run for absolutely no reason
